# `cueball`: An open-source theatrical cue player

This is a piece of software designed to ease and automate the sequenced playing
of various cues, especially sound and video. Designed to be an open-source
alternative to the commerical [QLab](https://qlab.app/), the eventual goal of
this project is to have a fully-featured cue player capable of professional
showrunning, while still being cross-platform and free for all to use.

**This project is stil *very* much under development, and is not yet ready for
real use.**
